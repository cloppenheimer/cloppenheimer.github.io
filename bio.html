	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p> Hi, I'm Clara! I'm fron Sag Harbor, NY. Currently, I am a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in computer science and minoring in Spanish. On campus, I am a teaching assistant, a member of the Society of Women Engineers and Women in Computer Science, and I teach engineering to elementary and middle school students through the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach. I enjoy reading, going to the beach, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
